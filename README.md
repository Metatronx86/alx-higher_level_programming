This directory contains the work I completed for the ALX Software Engineering's Higher Level Programming course. The course covers the following topics:

* Python programming
* Object-oriented programming
* Functional programming
* Data structures
* Algorithms

The directory is organized as follows:

* `0x00-hello_world` contains the code for the first project, which is a simple "Hello, world!" program.
* `0x01-variables_datatypes` contains the code for the second project, which covers variables and data types.
* `0x02-conditional_statements` contains the code for the third project, which covers conditional statements.
* `0x03-loops` contains the code for the fourth project, which covers loops.
* `0x04-functions` contains the code for the fifth project, which covers functions.
* `0x05-python_classes` contains the code for the sixth project, which covers object-oriented programming.
* `0x06-python_exceptions` contains the code for the seventh project, which covers exceptions.
* `0x07-python_input_output` contains the code for the eighth project, which covers input and output.
* `0x08-python_functions_and_modules` contains the code for the ninth project, which covers functions and modules.
* `0x09-python_data_structures` contains the code for the tenth project, which covers data structures.
* `0x0A-python_algorithms` contains the code for the eleventh project, which covers algorithms.
